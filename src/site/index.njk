title: This is a feature branch deploy (testing-functions branch)

<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<p>There are 2 functions deployed on this page. They are all deployed  using Netlify straight from the 
Git repo. Click <a href ="https://github.com/bhavana-netlify/product-demo/tree/testing-functions">here to check out the code.</a>

I am deploying this feature branch on Netlify so that I can test the functionality on an environment that is identical to Production before merging to main.</p>
